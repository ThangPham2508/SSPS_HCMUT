## Description
This repository contains the code for a Student Smart Printing Service. The code is organized as follows:

  - assets: This folder contains images, icons, fonts and other static files used by the web app.
  - components: This folder contains reusable React components.
  - pages: This folder contains the React components for each page of the web app.
  - slices: This folder contains the Redux slices for managing the state of the web app.
  - main.jsx: This file is the entry point of the web app, which renders the App component and sets up the Redux store and router.
- backend: This folder will contain the source code for the back-end server, which will handle the communication with the printers and the database. (To be added later)
